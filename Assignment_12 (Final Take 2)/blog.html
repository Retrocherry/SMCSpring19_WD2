                ADI has been full steam ahead on building our new ADI Wildlife Sanctuary in South Africa since we
                purchased the property last August. So far, we have built 12 enclosures, planted trees, built brick
                night houses and platforms/shelters for the cats to see the views. We received our permit to operate the
                sanctuary and have permission for all of our large cats. By the end of this year, our sanctuary will be
                home to over 40 big cats, rescued from circuses. See our progress at:

                <br>
                At the same time, ADI has been working this past year with Guatemala’s wildlife and animal welfare
                officials on enforcement of their country’s ban on animal circuses. We have rescued 21 lions and tigers
                so far, who are being cared for and prepared for export at our Temporary Rescue Center in Guatemala.

                    Congratulations New York City! As of tonight’s vote, wild animal circuses are consigned to history in NYC. Years of persistent campaigning and especially the work of CM Mendez has finally won through and we have the vote that just makes sense. Traveling circuses have no place in modern society.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Steady progress across the US over past few years has seen the number of jurisdictions making the change rapidly increase – now over 70 – joining nearly 40 countries around the globe whose governments have decided that it is time for the suffering in the name of entertainment to end.
                    <br><br>
                    A good day for animals.
                    <br><br>
                    Now support TEAPSPA – the Traveling Exotic Animal and Public Safety Protection Act in Congress. Let’s get this DONE.

                    What I love about this 60 Minutes show, is that the producers took the time to understand what it takes to get to the point where we can empty an entire country of all its circus animals. A decade of work involves the undercover investigations to gather evidence; the public education to spark and define the laws; intense work with government officials to plan and execute seizures of illegal animals. In under 15 minutes, 60 Minutes covers the whole story including the joyous finale where the lions return to their native land.
                    <br><br>
                    Without the investigations, scientific, legal and economic research, public education campaigns and new laws to protect animals, there are no rescues. Rescuing every circus animal in Peru, and taking the first nine of the now-outlawed Colombian circus animals, was a huge achievement. Just as we did in Bolivia (see ‘Lion Ark’ http://www.lionarkthemovie.com/).
                    <br><br>
                    The changes must be permanent, we must ensure the captive animals can never be replaced.
                    <br><br>
                    These rescues have educated governments, officials and the public to see these animals in a new light – intelligent, emotional individuals, lovers of their families and freedom to live as they choose, in their natural environment. Understanding their place on our shared planet.
                    <br><br>
                    There is more to do. More countries need help to make this happen.
                    <br><br>
                    Please help investigations–education–awareness leads to animal protection laws = rescues = lasting change:
