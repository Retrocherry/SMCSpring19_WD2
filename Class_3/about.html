            <p>It's a board with wheels. I had a horrible nightmare, dreamed I went back in time, it was terrible. Yeah, but I never picked a fight in my entire life. Leave her alone, you bastard. Jennifer.

                <P>God dammit, I'm late. I will. Thank you, don't forget to take a flyer. The flux capacitor. What, right here right now in the cafeteria? What is she said no? I don't know if I could take that kind of rejection. Besides, I think she'd rather go with somebody else.

                        Good. Have a good trip Einstein, watch your head. Calm down, Marty, I didn't disintegrate anything. The molecular structure of Einstein and the car are completely intact. Mayor Goldie Wilson, I like the sound of that. Precisely. Oh, I sure like her, Marty, she is such a sweet girl. Isn't tonight the night of the big date?
                        
                        You know, Doc, you left your equipment on all week. Jesus. Shut your filthy mouth, I'm not that kind of girl. Oh, you mean how you're supposed to act on a first date. The hell you doing to my car?</P>

                <h1>ABOUT THE CAST</h2>
            <p>Wait a minute, Doc. What are you talking about? What happens to us in the future? What do we become assholes or something? I don't wanna know your name. I don't wanna know anything anything about you. This is more serious than I thought. Apparently your mother is amorously infatuated with you instead of your father. Well, now we gotta sneak this back into my laboratory, we've gotta get you home. I think it's terrible. Girls chasing boys. When I was your age I never chased a boy, or called a boy, or sat in a parked car with a boy.
